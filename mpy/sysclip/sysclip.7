y2s - Stands for yank2system, yanks to your specified system clipboard defaults to xsel.\&
.SH BUFFERS

.SH NOTES
Some clipboards need some extra flags to work with sys-clip for example:
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
With "xclip" set as sys-clip, options flags "-i" and "-f" will be added so it does not hang, just select your text and run "y2s".\&

.RE
But others require no settings like:
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
"xsel"
