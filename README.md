# yed (Your Editor) AIO Edition

# TL;DR
**Yed but with my super defaults.**
I made this mostly for myself but if there is anything I can do to make it easier for others send me an email or open an issue on github.
```sh
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~uniquepointer/yed-aio && cd yed
make #or
`./install.sh -p ./test`
./test/bin/yed
```
Running `make` will put it on your .local/bin, so if you want a specific place youc an do `make LOC=/your/full/path/here`

If you got your own config just make a folder inside this fork called `userconf` and copy your `yedrc` and `ypm_list` and you can carry it with you.
Once you are done installing and run yed, you can just run `ypm-update`, you don't need an internet connection to compile and load your plugins!

## Go checkout Yed
